(structured abstract here)

Background: Psychopathy as it manifests in women is at present underexplored. The literature has uncovered an association between psychopathy and borderline personality disorder. It is anticipated that the presence of BPD will mediate the relationship between psychopathy and emotional processing (measured by alexithymia).

Methods: Collected data from 156 incarcerated women. Assessments of interest: PCL--R, PAI--BOR, STAI-Trait, TAS-20. Used mediation analyses with bootstrapping to test hypotheses.

Results: BPD fully mediated the relationship between psychopathy and alexithymia in our sample.

Conclusion: More research is needed to unpack these heterogeneous constructs.
