## DATA PROJECT ON PSYCHOPATHY, BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER, AND ALEXITHYMIA IN INCARCERATED WOMEN

### My data was obtained from a prior NIH grant that sought to further examine how psychopathy manifests in women.

### Along with demographics, many clinical and behavioral measures were collected, including _PCL-R_, _SIDP-IV_, _PAI-BOR_, _ZAN-BPD_, and _TAS_.

### This study will examine specifically the relationship between levels of psychopathy, borderline personality tendencies, and presence of alexithymia. I hope to be able to use R to develop a mediation analysis.

##### A likely hypothesis I propose: The presence of psychopathy will impact the relationship between borderline personality disorder and alexithymia in incarcerated women. More specifically, **increased psychopathy will exacerbate alexithymia symptoms in those with BPD**.
