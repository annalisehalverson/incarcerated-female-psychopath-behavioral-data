# Methods
We report how we determined our sample size, all data exclusions (if any), all manipulations, and all measures in the study. <!-- 21-word solution (Simmons, Nelson & Simonsohn, 2012; retrieved from http://ssrn.com/abstract=2160588) -->

## Material

## Procedure

## Data analysis
We used `r cite_r("r-references.bib")` for all our analyses.

```{r PAI_BOR_data_readin}

getwd()
setwd("../localonly/") # I don't know if I should be doing this every time but it's the only way I've figured out how to set path

library(readxl)

messy_PAI_BOR_df1 <- read_excel("Decety_assessment_data_copy.xlsx", sheet = "PAI_BOR", range = cell_cols("A")) # grab ID column
messy_PAI_BOR_df2 <- read_excel("Decety_assessment_data_copy.xlsx", sheet = "PAI_BOR", range = cell_cols("Z")) # grab PAI total score column
messy_PAI_BOR_df <- cbind(messy_PAI_BOR_df1, messy_PAI_BOR_df2) # combine 2 columns into one dataframe displaying unique ID and PAI BOR total score

print(messy_PAI_BOR_df)

# my data here is tidy since i only copied over columns i needed. however, this is a very simplified version of all the data i will be using. i purposefully picked an 'easy' sheet to practice with.
# the original sheet had score ticks for each question. for my purposes, this information was unnecessary.
  
```

```{r create_PAI_BOR_intermediate_dataset}

# 2 dplyr functions for pai-bor
# filter out non -1001 data points
PAIBOR_Total_Score <- ("PAIBOR_Total_Score")
filtered_messy_PAI_BOR_df <- messy_PAI_BOR_df %>% filter(PAIBOR_Total_Score > 0)
print(filtered_messy_PAI_BOR_df)

# arrange lowest to highest
sorted_filtered_messy_PAI_BOR_df <- filtered_messy_PAI_BOR_df %>% arrange(PAIBOR_Total_Score)
print(sorted_filtered_messy_PAI_BOR_df)

write.csv(sorted_filtered_messy_PAI_BOR_df, "cleanish_PAIBOR_sorted_filtered.csv", row.names = FALSE)
# not sure if I should keep lowest to highest as that ruins the order for the other sheets. it was a good test

```

```

``` {r structural equation modeling of factors}

# i have in my dataset factors that break down psychopathy, BPD, and alexithymia
# i think, especially for BPD(ZAN), it would be cool to analyze how these different factors might play into the relationship differently
# this reasoning is due to the inherent heterogeneity of what we consider in the literature to constitute a BPD diagnosis
# i have no idea how to approach this question though, and need to do more research into structural equation modeling (which i was told might be a useful approach here)
